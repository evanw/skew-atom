# Skew for the Atom Editor (deprecated!)

This package adds syntax highlighting for the [Skew programming language](http://skew-lang.org) to the [Atom editor](https://atom.io). Installation:

    apm install skew

WARNING: This is currently old and outdated. Please use the [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/evanw/skew-vscode) integration instead. Visual Studio Code has a much nicer IDE API that lets me add standard IDE features easily without needing to build stuff from the ground up, so I've switched over to that being the primary Skew IDE for now.
